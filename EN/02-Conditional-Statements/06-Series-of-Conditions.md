# Title
Sometimes we need to do a sequence of conditions before we decide what actions our program will execute

In such cases, we can apply the construction if-else if ... -else in series

For this purpose, we use the following format:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
else if (second condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
else if (third condition)
{
    // condition body;
}
â€¦
else
{
    // else construction body;
}
```
